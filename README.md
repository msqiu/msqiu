### Hi, my name is Zhouyan Qiu ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸ™‹Short description
I am now a doctoral student at the University of Vigo. Getting my Master's degree in Geomatics Engineering at the University of Stuttgart, Germany, I Have professional knowledge of Remote Sensing. My Master thesis focused on geometry-based rail track detection and blocking scenario identification using deep learning. I received my bachelor's degree in Remote sensing from Wuhan University in Wuhan, China.

As an Early Stage Researcher in the 'MENELAOS-NT' project, I am now working in the field of Mobile mapping applications of Compressive Sensing techniques in collaboration with IngenierÃ­a Insitu in Vigo. My research interests include Remote Sensing, Point clouds, Compressed Sensing, and 2D/3D Sensors for High Precision Cartography and Applications.
